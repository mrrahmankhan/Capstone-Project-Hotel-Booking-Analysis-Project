In this project to gain insights into booking patterns, customer preferences, and other key factors that influence hotel bookings.\n","####To begin, we collected a dataset containing information such as booking dates, customer demographics, hotel features, and booking outcomes. Using Python and its numerical programming capabilities, we performed various data analysis techniques to uncover meaningful patterns and trends.\n","\n","####Our analysis revealed several interesting findings. Firstly, we discovered that the majority of bookings were made within a specific time frame, indicating a peak season for hotel reservations. This information is valuable for hotel management to optimize their resources during busy periods.\n","####Additionally, we examined customer preferences and found that certain amenities, such as free Wi-Fi, parking facilities, and breakfast options, significantly influenced booking decisions. By understanding these preferences, hotels can tailor their offerings to attract more customers.\n","####Furthermore, we delved into the impact of pricing on booking patterns. Through statistical analysis, we identified price ranges that attracted the highest number of bookings and explored the relationship between price and customer satisfaction. This knowledge can assist hotels in setting competitive prices while maintaining customer satisfaction levels.\n","\n","####In our analysis, we also focused on customer cancellation rates. By analyzing the reasons behind cancellations, we identified potential areas for improvement in customer service and booking processes. This insight can help hotels minimize cancellations and increase customer retention.\n","####To visualize our findings, we utilized data visualization techniques in Python. Through interactive charts and graphs, we presented the patterns and trends we discovered. This visual representation made it easier for stakeholders to understand and make informed decisions based on the analysis.\n","\n","####Overall, our Hotel Booking Analysis Project provided valuable insights into booking patterns, customer preferences, pricing strategies, and cancellation rates. These findings can empower hotel management to make data-driven decisions, enhance customer experiences, and optimize their operations.\n"],"metadata":{"id":"F6v_1wHtG2nS"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["# **Conclusion**\n","\n","1. City hotels are more preferred by the customers than Resort hotels. ( from Chart - 1 )\n","2.
